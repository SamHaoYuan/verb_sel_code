# Probabilistic Verb Selection for Data-to-Text Generation
This is the Python code for our experiments of the paper ***Probabilistic Verb Selection for Data-to-Text Generation***,
along with the datasets of verb-percentage pairs extracted from three corpora.
## Prerequisites
Python 3.6+ and later, Anaconda 3.5 is better (the author used).

## Introduction
**AutomaticEvaluation:** the experiment of automatic evaluation(MRR).

**Data:** the verb-percentage pairs extracted from three corpora.

**Model:** our proposed model and two baseline models.

**Plot:** the code (Jupyter Notebook) for the figure in the paper.

**Questions:** the code for generating questions of human evaluation.
